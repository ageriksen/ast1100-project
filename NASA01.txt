NASA-møte 1 tir 30/08-16

første mål: lage rakettmotor

- fått seed til random solsystem.

"solar system class" som skal være i directory når man kjører kodene. 
	kan lage xml filer for unity.
7 parts, 1st this week. 

mye jobb, men få til alt, sikter mot A

simulate box w/ particles and pressure. this will be the rocket engine

		- note: move files from download to proper dir.

rocketmotor. 
the lecture notes have good descriptions as well as greater detail in pdf from Robert. 

3-bdy systetm with double sun is regular portion of course this year. generally 

> python myseed.pyc myusername
"someseed"

in py file
import ast1100Solarsystem
myss = myseed



write a weekly log
include thought process.


no one true sollution. 



there will be bugs, on account of small dev team - let them know if e.g. extreme planets or similar. 



thoughts on units used. 
particles in box
	kg of fuels
	velocity is not in SI, uses AU/year. 
		mainly for convenience. 
		prepare for transformations
		AU = 149 597 871 km

	periods given in years
	positions given in AU
	mass of planets given in sun-masses ("ms")

	mass of lander is in kg, pluss some others. 
	keyword: PAY ATTENTION TO UNITS
	radi might be km.


planet 0 is always homeworld, not necessarily the closest to the sun. besides in the livable sone, 
position

normally, NASA meetings, 1st hour for discussion, 2nd for working. new parts of project given out 
each week. roughly.




for the box, simulate the box, 
if tests to check if particle hits box. 
once opens hole, how much energy disapears in 1 direction, when exiting
remember to have appriopriately spaced time intervals. 
control code released later on day of writing.
