NASA meeting 200916 | meeting 04


We send commandes to mlp, not our own code. 
takes commands: 
    Launch
    Boost
    Video
    Orient


todays topic: 
	how to write software to interact with MCAst.

don't waste time making toooo specific. 

when boosting, 
	for fuel consump. need time, 

not too much noise, but ~~10% extra...

part 4:
orientation

what do we want to know when orienting?
	position
		sattelite has radar. 
		can measure dist to sun and planets in AU.
		from this, measure position
	angle
	hastighet
		plan is find 2 distant stars. what is doppler of stars
		compared to still (compared to sun)
		
		to find, point spectrograph on each star and compare to still. 



given flat image from sattelite camera, how can you compare this to spherical....sphere. 

	applying an inverse of a known transformation pattern from globe to flat. 
		The inverse will resize the image's parts. 

##
intermission:
THAT IS WRONG!!!!!
we need to take into account the projection of a 3D sphereshell onto a 2D plane. 

actually, just overcomplicating.

stereographic projection. 
	with small fov. 
##
		when known angle, can move to take picture of 2 stars
		use Doppler.


ved orientering, f√•r liste med avst per planet i: [r0_sat, r1_sat, r2, r3, ..., rN, r_sol]
				know [r1, rN]

	probs with circles, numerics. errors can compound to a lot.
